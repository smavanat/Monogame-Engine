Known Bugs:
Collision does not move when holding key in colliding direction and non-colliding direction
Can move into walls if using small key presses. Long key presses do not work though

Could also use Seperate Axis theorem or AABB boxes.

Things to add for GOAP:
Currently we have decent communication between all the objects involved. However the actoion does 
not seem to be occuring, rather the agent just sits in its starting position and spaces in and out
of existence. Need to figure out why. Maybe because GOAP is being called every frame? This does not
seem to be the case as the console only logs one response from the planner, not one every frame.
Or something to do with moveAction

Not necessary to add Entities currently but I really need to sit down and figure out how my ECS is
going to work because this system is held together by spit and lollipop sticks
