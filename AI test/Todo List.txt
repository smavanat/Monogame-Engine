For MVP:

Do a limited layout
Sprites for player and some NPCs

In General:
Total layout
Multi-floor buildings
In-game internet
Skills/Research
Map Editor

Known Bugs:
Can move into walls if using small key presses. Long key presses do not work though
Could also use Seperate Axis theorem or AABB boxes. - Fixed. Just changed:
 if (collider.IsColliding)
            {
                Position += Vector2.Zero;   
            }
in Player.Update() to:
 if (collider.IsColliding)
            {
                Position -= Velocity;
                collider.IsColliding = false;   
            }

Things to add for GOAP:
It is finished in its simplest form. Need to try it out now with more complex agents with many actions
Also need to try with many agents working together on some task.

Need to implement joined logger-woodcutter ai. Just need to add trees and modify ChopTreeAction.
Should look into Utility AI for proper decision making
