Known Bugs:
Collision does not move when holding key in colliding direction and non-colliding direction
Can move into walls if using small key presses. Long key presses do not work though
Possible solution: https://community.monogame.net/t/solved-how-would-i-go-about-sliding-a-collision-while-moving-diagonally/11343/3
Could also use Seperate Axis theorem or AABB boxes.
Sometimes one of the Quadtree arrays gives an out of bounds error. No clue why this happens. 
Restarting the program seems to fix it.

Things to add for GOAP:
It is finished in its simplest form. Need to try it out now with more complex agents with many actions
Also need to try with many agents working together on some task.

Not necessary to add Entities currently but I really need to sit down and figure out how my ECS is
going to work because this system is held together by spit and lollipop sticks
