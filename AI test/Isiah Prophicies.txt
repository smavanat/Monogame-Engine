I wanna follow the laws of man
Bloody apron, leg of lamb

I'll tell you what; I'd get up,
If I knew I fell.

THE FOLLOWING TWO COULD BE RELATED IN SOME WAY:

Sleep my friend, and you will see, 
The dream becomes my reality

Any of those who tresspass against us,
Whether they be beast or man,
Shall suffer the spite,
Or be shot dead on sight
By those who inhabit this land.

God was leaking through the stereo

Everybody was drowning in the fountain of youth

Drink to the dead, are you still alive?
We shall join them in good time

Life is hard, that's why no-one survives.

Life's the study of dying, 
And how to do it right.

I speak spanish to God, Italian to women, French to men, and German to my horse

I prince should be a fox to spot the traps,
And a lion to frighten away the wolves

When they kick down your front door,
How you gonna come?
With your hands on your head,
Or on the trigger of your gun?
When the Law breaks in, 
How you gonna go?
Shot dead on the pavement,
Or lying in death row?

Robot minds of robot slaves,
Lead them to atomic graves.

ENDCARDS:
I am Emperor of Rome. And above grammar

The machiavelli quote about free cities

And they shall beat thier swords into ploughshares,
And they shall not make war anymore

Democracy is the worst form of government save for all those other forms that have been 
tried from time to time.
